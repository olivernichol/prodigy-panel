# prodigy-panel
The Unity-built designed for tablets panel for my notification centralising project, Prodigy.

This panel acts as the core frontend of the Prodigy project - displaying the notifications, either current or saved. It's a fairly basic app, and frankly should not have been developed within Unity, but those were the choices I made at the time. With that said, I hope that the function of this code is interesting!
